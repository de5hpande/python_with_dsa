Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is a fundamental concept in biology. 
It proposes that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, 
inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. 
Darwin's theory suggests that the diversity of life is a result of the gradual accumulation of these advantageous traits over long periods of time. 
This groundbreaking idea was detailed in his 1859 book, "On the Origin of Species," and 
has since become a cornerstone of modern biological science, providing a unifying explanation for the complexity and diversity of life on Earth.
